PDCA-Based Recommendations for Service Process Improvement:

1. Slow Response Times ('response_time_bar.png'):
   - Departments like Water Resources show response times over 24 hours. Recommendation: Streamline their workflows to cut delays by up to 20%.

2. Cost Distribution ('cost_pie.png'):
   - High-cost department(s) like Public Works consume a large budget share. Recommendation: Review their resource allocation for potential efficiencies.

3. Predictive Insights ('predicted_vs_actual.png'):
   - The Gradient Boosting model (RÂ²=0.37) can reliably predict response times. Use it to proactively allocate resources and manage stakeholder expectations for high-risk requests.

4. Key Drivers ('feature_importance.png'):
   - The most important factor influencing response time is 'Department_Water Resources'. Focus improvement efforts on optimizing processes related to 'Department'.

Overall, applying these data-driven insights could yield significant efficiency gains and estimated cost savings of $7,266.00.
